# momentum_balance_inertia
Code for including inertia term to momentum balance equation in PorePy

Runscripts:
* run.py is for running the momentum balance as is in PorePy. The geometry is only slightly changed.
* run_dynamic_2D.py is for running the dynamic momentum balance in 2D.
* run_dynamic_3D.py is for running the dynamic momentum balance in 3D.

models directory contains the models (surprise surprise ...)

ParaView directory is mainly for .py scripts to run for visualization in ParaView.
